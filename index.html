                <p>There's a variety of balancing work being done for the upcoming update. Operator ban and pick rate are both being used to track popularity of certain operators. An observation blocker gadget is being implemented as another method to deny attackers information surrounding defence tactics that may be in place.</p>

                <p>Security behind the scenes has been being improved to make cheat development harder. MMR rollback was disabled temporarily to avoid bugs which have since been fixed which allows MMR rollback to be re-activated. Mousetrap has been launched on consoles to combat input spoofing using external devices.</p>
